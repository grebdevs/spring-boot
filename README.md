# Spring Boot - dev && learn
Exploring and learning more about Spring Boot and its surroundings.

## Agenda
This repo is a collection projects based on Spring Boot, each incorporating one or more aspects of Spring and enterprise Java. The approach is basically _learning by doing_, merging own ideas with what is learned from docs and guides.

## The projects
Maven is used to build and run the projects. Each project has its own readme with relevant info.

Current projects:

Project | Description
---     | ---
my-web  | A personal website with a REST API and database connection
jms     | JMS Web interface to send and receive messages using an ActiveMQ broker
