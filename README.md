# Spring Boot - dev && learn
Exploring and learning more about Spring Boot and its surroundings.

## Agenda
This repo is a collection projects based on Spring Boot, each incorporating one or more aspects of Spring and enterprise Java. The approach is basically _learning by doing_, merging own ideas with what is learned from docs and guides.

## The projects
Maven is used to build and run the projects. Each project has its own readme with relevant info.

Current projects:

jms     | JMS client with a web interface to send and receive messages using an ActiveMQ broker, optionally connected as Docker containers
